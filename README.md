# -FunMusic-for-RISC-OS
A simple music editor and player for RISC OS. 

This program was written for RISC OS 3, but it also works on later versions. Though on the most recent versions of RISC OS (for example, RISC OS for the Raspberry Pi) the text colours don't look right. I'll probably fix that somehow in a later version.
